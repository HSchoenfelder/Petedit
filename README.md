# Petedit

Summary
-------

A Petri Net editor written in C# using WPF and the MVVM pattern.

Purpose
-------

This Petri Net editor has been written to test the possibilities of the WPF when working with the MVVM pattern. It has not been written because I think it is very effective to write a highly dynamic application like a visual editor using MVVM! I just wanted to see if it could be done, how it could be done and to learn something along the way. For the same reason I have also foregone using any of the available MVVM frameworks and instead tried to build all the things that I needed myself (or, if that failed, assimilate them from stackoverflow), in order to keep things as clean and educative as possible. Of course using MVVM would be pretty much pointless without unit tests, which is why I am definitely going to add unit tests to the ViewModel next. I know, I should have done this already, but without knowing the pitfalls of what I was trying to accomplish, doing it the right way would have been just a little too much for me.
